Topics: Graphs - Connected Components, Topological Sort, Minimum Spanning Trees



PART 1
  One of those projects is building a space probe. The project task information will be given as follows: for each
task you will be given the task ID, description, duration in days, and the list of tasks that must be completed
before that task can commence

PART 2
  The space probes that were deployed to collect data were not equipped with advanced software which could
process data. For the sake of preserving energy, they were only equipped with minimum scanning, storage, and
computation capabilities, enough to collect and store information about each encountered planet. The collected
data includes a planetâ€™s technological advancement level, and a list of its closest neighboring planets (other
planets within its communication range). The discovered planets were assigned IDs as their official names are
not known yet.
